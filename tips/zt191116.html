<h3="tipscontent">
There may be various reasons for an ISP(Internet Service Provider) to block certain websites<br>
Most reasons may be to follow certain protocols or rules<br><br>
1.Some websites are blocked only by thier domain name and can easily be accessed by thier IP address.<br>
To find out IP address of any website, type in "ping yourdomain.com" in command prompt on your Windows OS (note:here yourdomain=the website you want to access).<br>
Now type the IP address recieved into the URL of your browser and access the website.<br><br>
2.Proxy websites can be used to access any websites.<br>
Go to any proxy website and enter the name of the website you want to access.<br>
Example:proxysite.com<br><br>
3.Some blocked websites can be access just by accessing the secured versions of thier websites<br>
What can be done is that instead of "http://yourdomain.com" we cant use "https://yourdomain.com" ,<br>
  this will allow us to access the secured version of the websites.<br>
Example:"https://kat.cr"<br>
4.Websites can also be accessed using a VPN service<br>
Any VPN software can be used to access a website<br>
A Virtual Private Network or VPN is a remote server that gives you private access through a public network.<br> 
VPN makes it looks as though you are browsing from the country where the server is located, thereby hiding your real identity.<br>
To access any website using VPN, simply open the software and click on any click on any of the country names on the list and access internet through that server.<br>
Example:Tunnelbear VPN.<br><br>
