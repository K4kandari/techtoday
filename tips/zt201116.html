Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, 
the protocol over which data is sent between your browser and the website that you are connected to. 
The 'S' at the end of HTTPS stands for 'Secure'. 
It means all communications between your browser and the website are encrypted.
HTTPS is often used to protect highly confidential online transactions like online banking and online shopping order forms.
Web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome also display a padlock icon in the address bar to visually indicate that
a HTTPS connection is in effect.
HTTPS pages typically use one of two secure protocols to encrypt communications - SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or
TLS (Transport Layer Security). Both the TLS and SSL protocols use what is known as an 'asymmetric' Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) system. 
An asymmetric system uses two 'keys' to encrypt communications, a 'public' key and a 'private' key.
Anything encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted by the private key and vice-versa.<br><br>
