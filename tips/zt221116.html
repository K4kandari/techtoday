<h3 id="pageheading">Increase torrent download speed</h3><br>
<p id ="tipscontent">
<p>Torrent is used by all of us to download movies, music , applications and much more.</p>
<p>I think having a good network is not the only need to speed a torrent. There is much more than that help to boost the speed of the downloading file.</p>
<p>below are some easy thing you can practice to increase torrent download speed.</p>
<p>1. Choose The Right BitTorrent Client:
The first ultimate step is to pick the right BitTorrent Client. Because not all the clients have updated and latest technologies to handle P2P(pear to pear). 
You have many clients out there, to name a few, like uTorrent, Vuze, BitComet or the BitTorrent client itself. Just make sure these are compatible with your existing Operating System.
<br><br>
2. Limit Your Upload Rate:
Seriously you can be generous by seeding. But if you are in an urgent situation then you can limit your upload rate. Because unlimited upload rate hits the download rate too. You don’t need to disable uploading,
just find the optimal upload speed and set the upload limit.
<br><br>
3. Good Number of Seeds and Peers:
Unless that torrent file has good number of seeds and peers you won’t be able to get that file quickly.
It is always better to download a file which has many seeders.
<br><br>
4. Do Not ‘Force Start’ Your Torrents:
I always wondered what this option does, it doesn’t actually make the download start smoother but damages it. Force Start is a way to start torrents to bypass queue settings and seeding priority settings, by this your overall download speed will actually suffer.
Mostly users use this option so that their torrents does not get queued.
<br><br>
5.Protect Torrent From Failing Trackers:
If your download is getting stuck then it could also be due to failing trackers. Failing trackers? That means the tracker is stopped functioning due to reasons like, the torrent deleted from trackers or the trackers died perhaps.
They might also experience some downtime. Sometimes torrents are removed from a tracker if they are older than a year.
There are many such reasons unfortunately
To prevent this, you have two ways:
1. Use Multi-tracker Torrents: You can add multiple trackers to a torrent.
Then if you are adding three trackers, the second one will take over if the first one fails.
2. Enable DHT: DHT stands for “Distributed Hash Table”. It acts as a peer-to-peer tracker. Supported by all the leading p2p clients
<br><br>
6. Use a VPN (or) Proxy:
Just like Firewalls, ISPs don’t like torrents either. They just restrict them, and if they see you downloading torrents, they probably limit your net speed. That’s where VPNs come to play. 
VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a tool which can confuse your Internet Service Provider (ISP), by this they cannot tell the difference between normal traffic and torrent traffic. They establish a virtual point-to-point connection, thus providing traffic encryption. Your ISP will have no idea what you are actually doing and they can no longer put restrictions on your torrent downloads. 
There are several popular VPNs like HideMyAss, Kepard, etc.
<br><br>
7. Remove Unnecessary Files:
In case of some downloads, you may end up downloading some unnecessary files. But, some clients like uTorrent allow us to view all the individual files of a download. You can unselect some unnecessary files in a download and increase the speed of your download. Familiarising yourself with all the settings in your BitTorrent client can also help you in managing your torrent downloads properly.
<br><br>
8.Upgrade Your BroadBand Plan or Optimize Your Net Speed:
That’s obvious isn’t it? Unless you have a good broadband connection you won’t be able to have a downloading speed. Check the maximum download and upload speeds allowed by your ISP since they have specific bandwidths for them
